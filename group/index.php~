									<h3>Dr Francesco Valentino</h3>
									<p>Francesco is a DAWN/DARK Fellow. He is studying the physical properties of both quiescent and star-fomrming galaxies in the early Universe, and the enviromental effects on the galaxy evolution. He is also the PI of a large ALMA [CI] survey of z~1.5 star forming galaxies. Before joining our team, Francesco completed his PhD Thesis at CEA Saclay under the supervision of Dr E. Daddi. He is also acting as co-supersor in the Master Thesis of Cecilie Sand Nørholm </p>

									<h3>Isabella Cortzen</h3>
									<p>Isabella is a PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute. She is working towards  establishing new tracers and methods to measure the molecular gas on the galaxies across cosmic time. Before staring her PhD, Isabella successfully completed her Master Thesis, entitled: 
										<i>"Examining the existence of two distinct modes of star formation
										A study of the gas reservoir and dust emission in star-forming
										galaxies across cosmic time"</i> under my supervision at Niels Bohr Institute. </p>

									<h3>Vasily Kokorev</h3>
									<p>Vasily is a PhD fellow at the Cosmic DAWN center studying the evolution of molecular gas in galaxies using Hershcel and ALMA continuum and atomic/molecular line observations. His interests also include the formation of first galaxies and the epoch of reionisation. He received his MSc degree in Physics with Astrophysics at the University of Sussex in 2018, where he have carried out work related to the 21 cm radio astronomy, while being advised by Mark Sargent.

									<h3>Simon Ponnchida</h3>
									<p>Simon is a second year Master student at the Niels Bohr Institute. His Master Thesis focuses on combining HST with ALMA observations of distant galaxies to study the spatial distribution and the interplay of stars and dust. Simon received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Copenhagen and did his Erasmus exchange studies at the University College London, UK.  </p>
