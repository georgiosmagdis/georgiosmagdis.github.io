									<h3>Dr Francesco Valentino</h3>
									<p>Francesco is a DAWN/DARK Fellow. He is studying the physical properties of both quiescent and star-fomrming galaxies in the early Universe, and the enviromental effects on the galaxy evolution. He is also the PI of a large ALMA [CI] survey of z~1.5 star forming galaxies. Before joining our team, Francesco completed his PhD Thesis at CEA Saclay under the supervision of Dr E. Daddi. He is also acting as co-supersor in the Master Thesis of Cecilie Sand Nørholm </p>

									<h3>Vasily Kokorev</h3>
									<p>Vasily is a PhD fellow at the Cosmic DAWN center studying the evolution of molecular gas in galaxies using Hershcel and ALMA continuum and atomic/molecular line observations. His interests also include the formation of first galaxies and the epoch of reionisation. He received his MSc degree in Physics with Astrophysics at the University of Sussex in 2018, where he have carried out work related to the 21 cm radio astronomy, while being advised by Mark Sargent.</p>
