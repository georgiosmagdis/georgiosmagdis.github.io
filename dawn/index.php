								<p>Following a demanding yet very rewarding process that started in 2016 and lasted for almost 18 months, we were awarded funding by the Danish National Research Foundation to establish a new, basic research, Center of Excellence: "The Cosmic DAWN Center". Along with experts from all around the world acting as external associates, we will embark on this journey in 2018, hoping to make DAWN one of the leading centers in the study of the early Universe. The center is dedicated to uncovering how and when the first galaxies, stars and black holes formed, through observations with the prime telescopes of the next decade (ALMA, JWST, Euclid, E-ELT, HST) as well as through theory and simulations.</p>
